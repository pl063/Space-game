# Space-game
Space game is an old-school, space-themed, basic side-scrolling game. 

# About the game:
You can use a username or play anonymously. (If you play anonymously, your username becomes automatically "Anonymous") At the end of the game, you will see your final score and current username.
You have two hearts, which means you can collide with enemies two times before you die(Your enemies are spaceships controlled by aliens). To protect yourself, pressing the Space key, you shoot fireballs that can destroy your enemies if you hit them successfully.
After your second colliding with an enemy spaceship, you have the opportunity to purchase a heart using coins(You should collect the coins during the game). You can buy a new heart only once. If you don't have enough amount of coins, the game is over. 
You can pause the game anytime using the pause button in the right corner of the toolbar. To resume it, press the same button again. You can quit the game as well by pressing the quit button. 
By destroying enemy spaceships, you gain points. For each destroyed ship, your points increase by 200 automatically. 
The state of your hearts, coins, and points is always displayed. You can see it on the left part of the toolbar.
